# go-playground 🌱

This is my personal playground for experimenting and learning new things in
[Go](https://go.dev).

## Pocket

Run tests, linting etc with [Pocket](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/pocket):

```sh
./pok
```

See `./pok -h` or `./pok plan` for more details.

Run tests, linting etc for a specific experiment:

```sh
cd <folder>
./pok
```
